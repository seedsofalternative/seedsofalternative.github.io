# What is happiness ?

Happiness is something we all want. This universal desire connects every sentient being, whether human or animal. Despite this shared aspiration, we rarely ask ourselves what happiness really is, and how to achieve this state. This is what we will explore together in this post.

# Definition

Buddhism distinguishes between two types of happiness: physical and mental. Physical happiness comes from sensory experiences—what we see, hear, taste, touch, or smell. As human beings, we are often captivated by sensory pleasures, from the taste of good food to the beauty of nature. Yet, while these experiences can be enjoyable, they are not enough to bring us true, lasting happiness.

Happiness, in its deepest sense, is a mental state. It doesn’t depend on external circumstances. You could be at a beautiful party with perfect weather and great company, but if your mind is troubled—perhaps by jealousy or annoyance—you won’t feel happy. Conversely, even in challenging conditions, a person with a peaceful mind can remain happy.

In that sense, happiness is a state of a lasting mental peace and well-being.

# The Trap of Temporary Pleasures

From the moment we wake up, every action we take is motivated by the wish to be happy and avoid suffering. However, although this desire guides us, we often don’t take the time to examine the quality of the happiness we seek.

Are we chasing temporary, fleeting pleasures? Or do we yearn for a deeper, more fulfilling sense of happiness—one that doesn’t fade away like the satisfaction of a new phone or a delicious meal? 

Many of us mistake temporary pleasures for true happiness. We chase after material gains, sensory gratification, and the approval of others, believing that these will bring us lasting contentment. However, these pleasures are stimulus-based—they depend on external factors, and once those factors change or disappear, so does our happiness.

# The eight wordly concerns

Buddhism categorizes this attachment-driven mindset most people have in their pursuit of happiness under “*8 worldly concerns”*: 

- **Gain vs. Loss**
    - **Gain**: The desire for material wealth and possessions
    - **Loss**: The fear of losing what we have, whether it’s money, possessions, status, or comfort.
- **Pleasure vs. Pain**
    - **Pleasure**: The craving for pleasurable experiences through our senses (e.g., good food, entertainment, physical comfort).
    - **Pain**: The aversion to discomfort, pain, or unpleasant experiences.
- **Praise vs. Blame**
    - **Praise**: The desire to be praised, admired, and validated by others.
    - **Blame**: The fear of being criticized, blamed, or ridiculed by others.
- **Fame vs. Disgrace**
    - **Fame**: The desire for a good reputation, status, or recognition from others.
    - **Disgrace**: The fear of being disrespected, losing face, or having a bad reputation.

Chasing after these concerns keeps us in a constant state of hope and fear, never fully at ease. The more we grasp at external things, the more agitated and dissatisfied we become.

# True Happiness Comes From Within

According to Buddhist teachings, lasting happiness is possible, but it doesn’t come from temporary, external stimuli. We constantly look outward for happiness, placing our well-being in the hands of things we cannot control—whether it’s material possessions, success, or the approval of others. The problem with this approach is that outer circumstances are impermanent. They change, and they are beyond our control, leading to a constant cycle of dissatisfaction.

Instead, true happiness arises from within, through the cultivation of a healthy mind. Cultivating this inner well-being requires us to shift our focus from the outside world to our internal world. We need to examine our thoughts, emotions, and perspectives and learn how to transform them in ways that promote lasting peace and contentment.

# A Balanced Approach to Happiness

Does this mean we shouldn’t enjoy life’s pleasures? Not at all. Buddhism doesn’t suggest we abandon all worldly pleasures. What it teaches is that while it’s fine to enjoy life’s pleasures, we should not depend on them for our happiness. Our well-being should come from within, so that even when outer conditions are tough, we can remain happy and content. The key to this shift lies in understanding our minds. 

> *“The way we live, the way we think, everything is dedicated to material pleasure. We consider sense objects to be of utmost importance and materialistically devote ourselves to whatever we think makes us happy. Even though all this comes from our mind, we are so totally occupied by external objects that we never look within. […]
We have to examine ourselves - not just our body, but our mind. After all, it is our mind that is always telling us what to do. We have to know our own psychology, our inner nature. We have to know our mind.”* - Lama Yeshe

# Conclusion

Happiness is something we all seek, but too often we look for it in the wrong places. By focusing on external pleasures and material gains, we trap ourselves in a cycle of temporary satisfaction and dissatisfaction. However, true happiness—lasting contentment—comes from within, it arises from cultivating our minds. By shifting our focus inward, we can begin to cultivate the genuine happiness that we all desire—a happiness that is stable, lasting, and independent of external circumstances.

# Recording Tushita

Talking about happiness. And I would like to start, with a quote that His Holiness, the Dalai Lama always gives when the Lama gives teachings here or also abroad, something he always mentions, which is a quote that comes directly from the Buddha himself when he says, All living beings want to be happy and do not want to suffer. All living beings, every sentient being, meaning every human being, every animal, every living being that has a mind, and even those we cannot see with the naked eye, they all have the same wish, wanting to be happy, wanting to have well-being, to be satisfied, to feel fulfilled, and wanting to avoid the opposite.

Not wanting to be unhappy, not wanting to have problems, to suffer, to feel bad. This is a very natural aspiration that we all share. In this wish, wanting to be happy and not wanting to suffer, we are all equal. We are all the same, aren't we? It's something very intuitive, you know.

And we might be rather unconscious of it most of the time, but actually, if we check and analyze our actions in our day to day life, looking in our life, and the actions that we do on a daily basis, it doesn't take too much to see that this wish, from the moment we wake up in the morning, going through our day, this wish is with us all the time. Whatever we do with our body, speech and mind, everything is actually motivated by the wish of wanting to be happy and not wanting to suffer. No. What's the first thing we think in the morning? Coffee, cappuccino.

If I get a cappuccino, I'll be okay. And that wish, wanting to be happy makes us get out of bed, then we go to the bathroom to relieve ourselves from suffering. And we go about our day, and every single thing we do, every conversation we have, you know, our family, our work life, whatever it might be, whatever action we do is basically, you know, accompanied by this intention, wanting to feel good, wanting for things to be okay, and not wanting to experience problems. But although this is the case, you know, although we always have this wish with us, we rarely, if ever, actually stop and ask ourselves the question, well, what actually is happiness? What is happiness?

What kind of happiness is it that I'm actually looking for in my life? What quality of happiness is it that I actually yearn for in my life? Are we looking merely for a kind of a short term happiness? A happiness that is short lived and is there for a while and then runs out again, like an incomplete form of happiness? Is that what we look for?

Sometimes the lamas down in town, when they give teachings here, they ask the students, okay. Who of you wants to be happy only for today and tomorrow finished? Who of you wants to be happy only for this week and next Monday, thus finito. 1 month. Any takers?

I mean, you know, I think it doesn't take too much to see that when we look inside and ask ourselves that simple question, usually people then like you kind of smile and, like, well, actually, I want to be happy all the time. Actually, the happiness, the quality of happiness I I wish for is a happiness that never runs out again. Basically, we want to be happy forever, don't we? Do you think about it? But rarely do we ask ourselves the question, well, what causes such a happiness?

Where would that come from? How do I go about achieving such a state of well-being? And the final question: Having had this wish of wanting to be happy throughout all my life with me all the time, have I achieved it or not? And if not, why not? From the Buddhist perspective, a sense of lasting contentment, well-being, a sense of lasting inner happiness that never runs out again and that is with you all the time forever, that is something which is possible.

It is achievable. We can cultivate something like that. But it is not something that arises from external circumstances as such, but it is something which arises from within your mind. It is something that comes from within, and the potential for such a happiness to be experienced by you lies within you right now already. It's here, right now, this potential.

It's just about how we are going to cultivate it. It's about how we work with our thoughts, our emotions, our perspectives, how we work with the mind. So let's look at this a little bit. Let's discover this more deeply. In Buddhism, we talk about various types or various forms of happiness.

There's various types of happiness that we can speak about, various ways of how we can classify what we call happiness or well-being. You know, first of all, when we look at ourselves as a person, when we check what we are, when we summarize ourselves as a person, we can talk about 2 main aspects of ourselves. We can talk first of all about our bodies, physicality, this body here. And then we can also talk about our minds, our thoughts, our emotions, our feelings, our internal world. Based on these two aspects, based on body and the mind, I say I.

Based on these 2, body and mind, I say wangdu Ni. In the same way, when we talk about various forms of happiness that we can experience, we can talk about these two levels. We can talk about the level of so called physical happiness as well as the level of happiness which is a mental happiness, so to say. And the physical happiness, the first one refers And if And if you think about it, whatever we experience in our day to day lives, whatever we experience from the outside world, whatever comes into us from the outside, we experience it through one of these 5 senses: seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or touching. And as human beings, we are very fascinated by sense objects.

We are very prone to following and looking for a pleasurable sense experience. Our 5 senses are constantly on the lookout for a pleasant, happy experience, isn't it? Our eye consciousness is constantly looking for pleasant things to see, pleasant signs. We like to look at a beautiful face of a loved one, we like to look at a sunset or the beauty of nature, We like to go to art galleries or, you know, don't mind watching Netflix once in a while, all night long, seeing something pleasant. Our ear consciousness, our hearing, is constantly on the lookout for pleasant sound.

We enjoy the pleasant voice of a loved one. We like to listen to the sound of the birds or the rain dropping in a nice way on the roof, on Zoom, stream flowing by, the sounds of nature. We like to listen to our favorite music, whatever we consider good music to be. Ear consciousness is always looking for pleasantness. Same goes for our smell and taste consciousnesses.

We like to experience good smells. We like to experience good tastes. Taste is a big one for us. Not only do we want our food to be nourishing and, you know, sustain our body and health, but it should taste good every single time. Morning, lunch, dinner.

And we don't mind a good dessert every day. Always something different. Right? Also, our body consciousness, our touch sense, constantly on the lookout for pleasant experience. We like to wear pleasant, comfortable clothing, to sit on, comfortable beds, cuddle up in comfortable duvets, and once in a while, we don't mind having a hot bath, which is not so easy to find here in northern India.

It's more hot bucket showers, which is fine too. So our 5 senses are always active, looking for pleasant input. But the question we have to ask ourselves is: If all of our 5 senses are pleased, when all our 5 senses are satisfied, does that mean that we are necessarily happy? And again, it doesn't take too much to see that this is not the case. Happiness, in the end, is a mental state.

It is a state of mind. And I think we know that quite well from our own experience that from the outside everything might be great, everything might be wonderful, but still we feel empty inside. We are not happy. Right? I mean, we know, for example, we've all been to parties, you know, when your friend invites you to a party and, you know, your friend, she has organized this amazing location out in the woods, on the hills.

It's a beautiful, dry Saturday evening, you know, sunset, and all your friends are there. She has decorated the place beautifully. There is a nice buffet, you know, has good food, good drinks. A great band is playing, good conversations are going on. It's a really good vibe, and, actually, externally, things are quite perfect.

You think, woah. This is this promises to be a great evening. You know? Incredible. But, you know, if your mind is irritated, if something bothers you emotionally, if you feel annoyed by something, if you are upset or you feel jealous because your boyfriend talks to this other girl all the time or boy all the time, you know, if, internally, the mind is agitated, doesn't really matter how many pleasant inputs you have from the outside, Mind will not feel happy.

The mind will not be at peace. Can any physical comfort ensure you mental peace? Peace of mind. Not really. Because we might stand there with our drink in this party and think, I gotta get out of here.

This is not my evening. And everyone is like, why are you leaving? It's just beginning. Like, yeah. I already have enough.

Because internally, the mind is not at ease. But if you take a different example, for example, you take a situation where outer conditions are quite rough. You know, you know, you are in South India and you are on a, you know, 18 no, 40 hour train. There are these long trains in India, you know, 40 hour train ride. It's 45 degrees, South India.

You have not really booked up a ticket, you just have this small kind of bunk bed, but everyone, all kinds of people sit on it already. You have no space, you have diarrhea, you feel feverish, and the train stopped for some reason. You have no idea why, you know, but it's only 18 more hours to go. It's like, oh, you know, this is it's outside. Things are rough, you know.

Conditions physically are tough. But you might have this vision in your mind. I'm going to Kerala to do this Ayurveda course that I've been looking forward to for months, and I'm going to do this. You have a motivation. You have an attitude.

You have a goal. You know? Your mind has a purpose. If that is the case, then although outside things might be tough, doesn't really matter so much. Your mind can still be very happy.

Your mind can still have a you know, has a purpose. It has meaning. And therefore, mentally, you are okay. And outside difficulties don't bother you so much. Or also if you meet, you know, some of the yogis that live by the side of the hill about 25 minutes' walk from here, there's an area where monks and nuns do retreat for sometimes 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, life lifetime retreats under the guidance of the Dalai Lama.

They are living in completely simple situations. They just have a stone hut with a tin roof, you know, they own basically nothing but their clothing and maybe a cup and plate and a blanket. You know, in monsoon or also in winter, conditions are really tough, you know, outside the surroundings. Not easy to live that life. But when you meet them, when you look into their eyes, they are glowing.

They are so internally, you can feel, oh, their minds are very open and happy. Because what do they do all day long? They spend all day dedicating all their energy into probing the depths of their mind, working on themselves inside. So my point here being that I'm trying to express to you, from among these two types or forms of happiness, it is really the mental one which is of greater priority. Outer conditions, sense objects, are just they can act as a condition for feeling happy, but happiness is something which actually arises from within our minds.

It is a mental state. It has its source in our minds, in how we think, in our own perspective. This proves, actually, what we just talked about, that happiness doesn't come from external things to us as such. But, this is our main misunderstanding, usually, in our life. This is our intuitive misunderstanding because in our lives, we never really look inside.

We never really pay attention to the mind because in our lives, what do we do? We are constantly looking out. We make our inner well-being totally dependent on external circumstances. Constantly, we are looking outside for various experiences, wanting to acquire material possessions, looking for sense of pleasure, looking for fame, for success, for good reputation, being liked by others, besttraveling in India ever kind of a thing, you know. We look for all these things, consciously or unconsciously.

We put so much energy, so much time and effort into getting these things, believing them if I have them, they will provide me with a genuine form of lasting happiness. But no matter how much we do that, as I think we know from our own experience, somehow, on the long run, again and again, we end up dissatisfied. Why? Why does it not really work looking for happiness on the outside? Well, one reason is simply because we do not have control over outer circumstances.

All the various outer situations that we chase after, they are impermanent. They do not last. They depend on causes and conditions, and they keep changing. They are not stable. And therefore, outer situations and circumstances cannot really act as a basis for lasting inner satisfaction.

You know? Outer things, things change all the time, don't they? Nothing is as stable and lasting as we expect it to be. No outer circumstance is under control, actually, the way we expect it to be. We think we have control over things, you know, but if you really think about it, we don't really.

Some things we have control, but many things, not really. So if we make our inner well-being, our state of happiness, dependent on external circumstances alone, which are constantly changing and we don't really have control over, that means we then do not have control over our own well-being. And that's a problem. You see that? That's a problem.

So the Buddha's discovery was that at the moment we are looking for happiness mostly in the wrong place. At the moment we confuse temporal pleasures with actual inner fulfillment at happiness. And this confusion causes us a lot of frustration. So there's another division, another way of how we can talk about happiness, and that is we can talk about pleasure pleasant temporary experiences and what we call in this tradition actual or genuine happiness. When we're looking for happiness as mental states, for example, there is also these 2: temporary pleasures and actual lasting happiness.

When we look at the first one, at pleasure, this is what we normally regard or consider happiness to be. It refers to various experiences that are pleasurable, that give us a pleasant feeling. Experiences that are enjoyable momentarily. You know, getting something nice, experiencing something comfortable, experiencing something pleasant. And pleasure is by its very nature temporary.

It doesn't really last. Pleasure is there only if certain conditions come together then a certain pleasurable experience arises. It is what we call stimulus based happiness. It's a form of happiness which is based on a particular stimulus. As long as that stimulus is there, yes, happiness is also there.

But as soon as that stimulus is gone, my happiness is also gone. And pleasure, this is what we usually live for in our lives. What we usually look for in order to feel good. We put a lot of effort and trust in pleasure, receiving pleasure to make us happy. And in general, I mean, there is nothing wrong with the experience of pleasure.

It's not. But the thing is, we are so habituated in our life to follow after pleasure. So much of our life is lived in this habitual pattern, this automatic habitual behavior to look for pleasure all the time that we rarely ever question pleasure. We rarely check, is these various forms of pleasure that I get, are they actually fulfilling me? Is it actually making me more happy internally?

Like, really? Or not? So in this tradition here, following temporary pleasures is presented in a presentation that is called Following the 8 Worldly Concerns. The 8 worldly concerns are presented in 4 pairs: 4 things that we really want to get and 4 opposite parts that we always try to avoid and not want to have. And the first pair of the so called 8 worldly concerns that we usually follow after is called wanting to have gain, to experience gain and not wanting to experience loss.

And gain here refers to material gain. It refers to getting money, getting wealth, having various possessions. Wanting to have things and therefore filling our life with stuff. A new laptop, new furniture, another pair of trousers, a new car, a new watch, you know. Having this inner feeling, thinking that the more that we have, the more that I get, the happier I will be.

So in our lives, we put a lot of energy and time and effort in into obtaining new things, unconsciously attempting to buy our way to happiness. But it never really ends And it doesn't actually satisfy us. Right? I mean, for a moment, maybe it does. We all know how it feels.

You know, how does it feel to buy a new thing? Buying a new smartphone, for example. You looked it up on the Internet already, the new one has come out. You checked all its new features and its great qualities, and then you walk to the Apple Store or Samsung Store, whatever your brand is. Let's say it's the Apple Store.

You walk inside, and then you see, oh, you already see the box. No? There is the new phone that you want to buy, and you go there and you check with the guy and gives you the box and you give your card and then you buy the thing, and then the Apple Store person says congratulations to your purchase. They always congratulate you. This is very interesting.

Thank you. Thank you very much. Then you have it, you know, and then you put the new phone, the box, into your bag. And you walk out of the store with your new phone in your bag, and you know I have it. You maybe walk through town, maybe you have to run a few other errands, you have to maybe buy some groceries here or there, do other things.

Whatever happens, even if unpleasant things happen, doesn't matter so much because you know I have my new phone in my bag. It's with me. Then you walk home, then you put your bag on the table, you open z, you take out the new product, and then you start to unbox it. And anyone who ever opened a Apple product knows how each and every movement of even opening the box gives you a certain sense of pleasure. Right?

It goes so far that we even go on YouTube watching other people unbox and other things, getting pleasure from that. So we take it out and there is the new form. You have it. And the mind is kind of giving you have this hit of, like, a dopamine hit. Don't get this kind of feeling of happiness.

But during that time, when you look below the surface, when all of this happens, if you check, is your mind actually at peace? Or is it simply agitated? Is it actually quite, you know, it's excited, it's uplifted, but also automatically what comes with that rush of, wow, new phone, what is also there is the fear of having to lose it again has also started. The fear of what if it breaks? My new phone has already begun with that happiness also.

So you keep the foil on the screen, you don't take it off for a day, you just leave it on for a while just to protect the screen a bit. And after a while, you take it off and you buy all these covers and you take a lot of care of your new phone for maybe a few weeks. But, you know, one day it's gonna happen. Gosh. The moment will come where it falls down in front of others and you're like you act as if it's nothing.

No problem. Just fell down. It's okay. But internally, you know, your heart is shaking. You pick it up.

And you look at it. It's only a small scratch like it again. But still, it's like a scratch in your heart, isn't it, for a moment? So the thing is, this form, which is now so new and seems as if happiness is coming from it, it's going to break anyway. We know that.

Right? That's the very nature of the thing. But that fear of having to lose it makes your mind very agitated in a subtle way all the time. So grasping at getting things and not wanting to lose them is the first pair of our worldly concerns that keeps the mind agitated. The second pair of weird worldly concerns is called wanting to experience pleasure and not wanting at all costs to experience a painful experience.

In our lives, we are constantly on the lookout for pleasure, in a sense wanting to experience sense objects, sense input, sensual gratification. So we spend a lot of time in our lives going out for dinners with friends, we go for parties, we go for concerts of our favorite bands, We go on holidays, we lie on beaches, we meet friends for coffee, we have physical contact with others, we travel. Nothing wrong with all these things, don't get me wrong. But the thing is, a part within us equates these temporal pleasures with happiness. In a sense of the more temporal pleasures I get, the happier I will be.

Is that the case though? And as soon as there is a I mean, if there's a painful experience arising, as soon as some things don't go the way you want them to go, as soon as you have displeasure or a painful emotion, you immediately want to get rid of it. The mind is very immediately want you want to get it out of your life, having this feeling that a painful feeling or a painful emotion is necessarily a source for suffering. Is that the case? We will discover that it's not the case that there is a difference between pain and suffering because maybe it's exactly that painful experience or painful emotion which becomes your opportunity for internal development, which becomes your chance to make a change inside that is gonna make you lastingly grow into the person that you want to become.

We're gonna look at that more soon. In addition to these first two pairs, also what we pay a lot of attention to, what we put great importance on as human beings is what other people think about us. The third way is called wanting to be praised by others and not wanting to experience blame or criticism. Again, we equate admiration from others with happiness. The more others admire me, the more others praise me for what I do, the happier I will be.

So when other people say, wow. You're such a great drawer. I love your drawings. What you do is incredible. You are so talented.

The mind is like, wow. Thank you. I'm not so good, actually. I'm just a beginner. No.

You're really good. Like the ego. You are such a great speaker. Your vocabulary is so incredible. I could listen to you forever.

It uplifts the mind. I love the way you dress. I love your new kind of style. You know? It looks so good on you.

Have you lost weight? No. I don't. I don't live at all. Yes.

Maybe. But if somebody criticizes you, if somebody blames you for something and somebody says, woah, have you been out partying last night? You look really hungover. You think, no. I went to bed at 9:30.

We go into our room, look in the mirror. What does she mean hungover? But I feel very uptight. You know? The slightest little criticism is there.

You know? The mind we know. The mind goes around and around. Oh, why? Right?

A version arising. So therefore, we put ourselves a lot into situations where other people praise us, unconsciously looking for situations where we are admired to get that feeling of pleasure. And we do all we can to avoid at all costs any form of criticism or blame. The same goes for the 4th pair, which is called wanting to have a good reputation and not wanting to experience a bad reputation. Not only is it important to what people say to us directly, but it's so important to us what people say about us to others behind our backs.

Again, equating a good reputation for happiness, thinking if others say I'm successful, if others believe I'm successful, even though I maybe I'm not. If others think I have a great relationship and I have a great holiday, even though I might have huge troubles in my relationship and my holiday is really very boring, if on Instagram I get the likes and people I I can paint that picture of myself that others will believe it, that will become a cause for my happiness. We think like this. It's very interesting, actually. And as soon as others talk badly behind my back, as soon as my reputation goes a little bit down, others think I'm not successful, although I might actually be, that we see as a cause for suffering.

So you see, we constantly seek to gain, to get the things on the left. We call them the 4 desirable objects. And we do all we can to avoid the things on the right, which we call the 4 undesirable objects. But you know, this approach, this strategy, this lifestyle, when it comes to our quest for happiness, when we follow this approach, does it actually bring us closer to becoming more genuinely happy, genuinely content? Meaning, does getting the things on the left, if you get them, all of them, does that guarantee you that you will become a happy human being, fulfilled?

It does not really. If that were the case, if the things on the left, when you get them, would guarantee you a happy life, then this would mean by default, logically, that the most wealthy, the most famous, the most successful people in the world are necessarily also the happiest people on the planet. And, again, it doesn't need too much to see. This is not the case. I always have to quote one of my, you know, famous actor Jim Carrey, who's one of my childhood heroes.

When he said, I wish, there's a quote from him actually, I wish that every person could experience wealth and fame and success so that they can all directly experience that this is not it. It's not gonna guarantee you that you're gonna be happy. Often, it can be the opposite on the long run, that people who are super wealthy, super praised and successful and famous, they often often experience great loneliness and have to deal with strong mental problems and confusion. In fact, when once our basic needs are met, more success, more money, more things, following these concerns here more and more does not bring us more happiness. But ironically, on the opposite, it makes us more and more dissatisfied.

Following this approach cannot really lead us to lasting contentment. So why? Why exactly is this approach problematic? Why is constantly longing to get the things on the left and constantly longing not to experience the things on the right why is that problematic in our quest for genuine happiness and peace? Well, first of all, because the things on the left, they are, by their very nature, transient.

They don't last. Whenever you get them, they will run out again. They are, as we said, stimulus based. No? That means, by definition, if something is stimulus based, that means it is, by its nature, transient.

Because if a stimulus is there, yes, it's there, the happiness. But if the stimulus runs out, the happiness also runs out. So, therefore, the things on the left are completely unreliable. Sometimes we experience them and they are there, yes, but we have no control over them. They are just a temporary rush of excitement, really.

But since we intuitively believe the things on the left to be a source of well-being for me, if I have them, what happens is we run after them again and again, and a sense of clinging and attachment to them arises, wanting to have them over and over and over. So we begin to amass a lot of stuff. We, you know, we we create this addiction, really, to getting things and having pleasure and being praised, which sadly is very much encouraged by our society To maintain this addiction as consumers through advertising, technology, our Instagram feeds, Internet screen addiction, it completely infiltrates our lives, doesn't it? It's in our bedrooms, right, before we go to sleep and as soon as we wake up. So this actually, you know, keeps us in a constant state of worry and fear if we're constantly putting our trust in the things on the left making us happy?

What if I don't get them? And if I do get them, what if I don't get enough of them? And if I do get enough of them, what if I have to lose them again? I mean, we know that even if we get what we want, as soon as you have a fantastic reputation and success in your career, then you think, oh my goodness. Now I have to keep that up.

You know, what would other people think if I lose it again? Yeah. He was successful once. Becomes a very stressful, agitated mind. You buy an expensive thing, you worry about it.

The more things you possess, the more worries you have, isn't it? So it causes a lot of disappointment. Now that I have it, it doesn't really satisfy me anyway. You know that? But then we think, well, now that I have it, it doesn't satisfy me because I don't have enough.

Maybe if I get more, then I'll be satisfied. So we want more, we start to overindulge. And what we end up experiencing is what we call a constantly reoccurring cycle of hope and fear. Hoping for the things on the left to manifest in my life and fearing for the things on the right to happen. This cycle of hope and fear causes us a lot of suffering, which is why we say in Buddhism, a mind that is attached to outer stimuli, temporary pleasures, a mind that latches onto that is by definition a mind that is never relaxed.

It is a mind that is never at ease. We are constantly looking for something, right, which means we are always dissatisfied. A mind attached to the 8 worldly concerns can never be peaceful because we have constantly this over expectation for the next thing to be it, for the next thing to make me happy. And it causes us suffering. It causes us mental suffering, disappointment, frustration.

Of course, I mean, a basic level of necessities we need in our lives. Don't get me wrong. We do probably need, most of us, a roof over our head and having food and clothing, having a daily livelihood and so forth. I mean, there is certain basics that we need to be able to live a a good life. They should come together, right?

Yes, sure. But I think each and every one of us has that. But still, some degree or the other, we feel dissatisfied. Something is still missing. We are not totally happy yet.

That's why we hear maybe. I don't know. Why is that? It's because of our attached minds. It's because of our craving minds.

So the Buddhist approach here is first of all to begin to think about and train ourselves in letting go, which is also to release our grasp, also called to renounce the thought of wanting to have the 8 worldly dance things. To let go of holding on to what actually brings us dissatisfaction of running after pleasure all the time, being overly obsessed with temporal pleasures, but instead generating the aspiration, wanting to end this reoccurring cycle of dissatisfaction, of hope and fear. It means to consciously want to give up this being in that spiral and understanding how it unfolds, how it happens in my life and then making a decision of wanting to let go of our unhealthy attitude towards pleasure. It's not the pleasure itself which is the problem. It's the unhealthy attitude we have towards it, meaning our attachment to it which creates problems for us.

When we are able to let go of that, in this way we can make more space in the mind to create the causes in our life for a more lasting, genuine form of happiness. And this really is the entry point, the beginning point to go into the spiritual path. The Buddha would say, real happiness begins once we start to let go of our attachment. Then the question sometimes comes up from students to me when they say, well, Bandu, are you telling us that we are not meant to enjoy our lives anymore? Does it mean we shouldn't enjoy things anymore?

Well, no. Of course not. There is nothing wrong with, you know, having possessions. There is nothing wrong with enjoying a good meal or a good party with friends once in a while. There is nothing wrong with having a good reputation or somebody praising you.

The problem is not with the thing, you see. The problem is, again, our unhealthy attitude that we have towards these things. It's our craving for these things that becomes a problem, our grasping at them. Our believing intuitively that the more of, you know, the more I get of them, the happier I will be and believing if I don't get them and the things on the right come into my life, then I am bound to be unhappy. If somebody blames me, I have a bad reputation, I experience loss, I'm bound to be unhappy.

This is simply not true, as we would see. So it's our dissatisfied mind which is the problem. The mind of attachment desire. This is why this presentation is called the 8 worldly concerns, not the 8 worldly things. It's our unhealthy concern with pleasure that causes us suffering.

So it's fine to enjoy pleasure, sure. It's fine, it's okay to enjoy sense objects. But what the Buddha tries to convey to us is that the joy that we get from sense objects is minimal in comparison to the joy that we get from cultivating our minds. I'm gonna repeat that one because I like it very much. The joy that we get from sense objects is minimal in comparison to the joy that we get from beginning to cultivate our minds.

Which leads us to this second main type or form of happiness which is called actual happiness or genuine happiness. Actual happiness refers to what the Buddha taught happiness really is. What he discovered in his own practice after a long time of contemplation and looking inside, what he discovered where happiness actually comes from. And this refers to a genuine form of inner satisfaction. A form of inner confidence, of inner satisfaction and security about yourself, about others, about things that happen in the world and how to deal with them internally.

A sense of inner confidence and satisfaction that is always with you. No matter so much the outer circumstances. But it is with you wherever you go, wherever you you know, whomever you engage with in whatever you do. So we talk about a sense of lasting well-being. Our well-being that once cultivated, once we train ourselves in that, will not run out again, but it will grow further and further and further.

It's a happiness that is not stimulus based, you know. It is a happiness that doesn't come only when a certain circumstance is around the corner or a certain stimulus comes together. No matter what stimulus is there or not, its disinform of happiness is here. And when all the stimuli for pleasure are there, you enjoy them. When they run out, you're like, oh, now they run out.

No problem. Because I'm not dependent. My well-being is not dependent on that circumstance. I have it in here, which means I can relate to whatever circumstance in a much more realistic way, relaxed and easy, fulfilled way. And this is a happiness which derives from spiritual practice.

It means instead of being overly preoccupied with external circumstances and outer stimuli, always changing things on the outside, manipulating our surroundings with the expectation to find happiness, Instead, we begin to look inside, beginning to investigate ourselves, investigating our own minds. How are things within? It means getting to know yourself from within, familiarizing yourself with yourself, first of all, and learning methods of how to change things on the inside, investigating your inner world. Because in the end, how you experience the external world is completely determined by what's happening inside yourself. Right?

So we begin here to see the value of cultivating a mind of inner peace, a mind of non harm, we say. Not harming others, not harming yourself, living a life based on the principle of non violence and compassion, which in Buddhism encompasses the Buddhist idea of ethics, a life of non harm. And the basis of that, developing a stable mind, cultivating a calm, clear and focused mind with the practice of mindfulness and introspection, developing our attention, making our mind a more useful tool to actively begin to increase our inner positive qualities, such as love, compassion, and wisdom, and overcome our harmful tendencies, harmful habits of attachment, anger, and so forth. And doing that then, ultimately, eventually, training ourselves in the wisdom that realizes the nature of reality. Realising the nature of oneself as a human being, of others, how things work together which will then become the actual source of lasting contentment.

It is insight into the nature of reality based on a stable mind which is born from a mind of inner peace and compassion. This is something, when we spend time to begin to cultivate that and learn methods how to do this, this will become really worthwhile. And then a real sense of joy arises within your heart. Again, I always have to emphasize that we are not saying that you should not enjoy a temporary pleasure. That is not the point.

Of course temporal pleasures are okay, but what we are saying is, maybe in our life, and it's good for you to check that in your own experience, your own life, maybe in our life our constant focus on wanting temporal pleasures actually hinders us. It stands in the way of cultivating the causes for genuine well-being and happiness. We usually think deep down that if I get enough pleasure, it will bring me actual happiness. But it doesn't work. On the opposite, you see, our own unhealthy craving for pleasure stands in the way of having the energy to create this.

So, one way of looking at these two types of happiness is, one way of how we can see this is that pleasure arises from what we get from the world. From the outside, temporary things. What I want, what I crave. The temporal enjoyable experience is from the outside. Whereas actual happiness arises from what we bring to the world.

It is insight. It has to do with what you give, what you contribute, and how you contribute. And from among these 2, it is really the latter, the second one, which is our actual goal, which is our actual potential. What we want to what we actually wish for when we think I want to be a happy human being. How to do that though?

That's the question of course. Where does that really come from? How do we cultivate it? This is the point now where I would like to introduce to you, Lama Ye She. Lama Ye She.

I think, Venerable Kumpen yesterday in the introduction talk, along with you, already talked a bit about the 2 Tibetan lamas that came here and established this place and other places. And, you know, it's a very inspiring story because Lama Yeshe, he was an extraordinary individual once he escaped Tibet after the occupation of the Chinese government in 59. He came to India and lived a few years in India, continued his studies and practice together with his disciple, Lama Zogaribuje. And that was a little bit later, the time also when first of all the hippies came to India from the west of Australia, US, Europe. People who wanted to find an alternative way of life and find more meaning in their lives apart from, you know, the conditions that they have grown up in in their society.

So somehow this, you know, magnetic situation happened that these Tibetan lamas from Tibet, with the ancient wisdom of Buddhism, met with these hippies from, western society. And these hippies said, we want to learn about Buddhism. And Ramesh said, what? You want to learn about Buddhism? Are you serious?

I said, yes, we are serious. He was very happy about that. And he said, okay, I'll try to teach you. So he started to learn English more and more. He learned most of his English actually from the hippies, which, yeah, caused him to have a very interesting way of expressing himself in English.

He's very wonderful. And Lameric had a very wonderful way of communicating. He had an incredible skill, an incredible gift of communicating this ancient wisdom in a way that not only people from the West, but modern day people growing up in modern day society, also in India and Asia this day, of course, can connect with that in a way that it makes sense to people. And he says the following. He says, look into your mind.

The way we live, the way we think, everything is dedicated to material pleasure. We consider sense objects to be of utmost importance and materialistically devote ourselves to whatever we think makes us happy, famous, or popular. Even though all this comes from our mind, we are so totally occupied by external objects that we never look within. We never question why we find them so interesting. So we have to examine ourselves, not just our body, but our mind.

After all, it is our mind that is always telling us what to do. We have to know our own psychology, our inner nature. We have to know our own mind. This is his advice. And he would say, if we don't know our own minds, how can we ever expect to find mental peace?

Like that, this is what we try to look into here. This is our topic. Any questions with respect to this, what we've just talked about? Anything that comes up that you would like to bring into class? Nothing yet.

Anything. Yes. Where to start to get to know your mind? What does it mean to investigate your mind? That's a very good question, isn't it?

Well, I'm going to share it with you soon. That's what we are, you know first of all, we see the importance of doing it, but then the methods of how to do it. First of all, we have to learn know what the mind actually is. Is. First of all, learning it intellectually.

How within Buddhism they have mapped out the mind this phenomenon we call mind in a very particular way and have incredible ways and detailed instructions of how we can learn about this, first of all, intellectually and then putting it into practice, experiencing it, you know, in our own experience. And we're gonna start that in the next session after a short break. You're gonna get there. Yeah. As we will see, mind and ego are not the same.

Ego itself is a bit of a tricky word because we had it has a certain connotation for us. Ego is a Latin word which simply means I. And what the I is, how we experience the I, and how this I is often overwhelmed by, you know, self centeredness, so that we think I am the center of the universe, and we develop a very big ego, as we will see when we investigate what the eye actually is and how the eye relates to the mind and the body since they are not exactly the same, we will get more insight on how also to deal with the unhealthy I am the center of the universe ego to develop a more healthy and more balanced, but still powerful and inspired sense of self that we can then use to apply these methods to maybe, eventually, on the long run, overcome this whole notion of a fixed I here and a fixed world out there once and for all, and to see our relative existence that we actually are without feeling I am this me over here, and there's all these others out there, and we are totally separate from each other.

There's also something that's gonna come up. We're gonna look at very much in detail. Yeah? So the question is, if we develop a sense of happiness that I'm advertising here, a sense of actual happiness that doesn't run out anymore, that it's kind of constantly with you, is that always the same on day 1 to day 2? Is it like something that doesn't change and it's just always there?

Well, actually, I think it's something that grows. It is a basic sense of no, it is something which arises from really understanding ourselves as a person, understanding how phenomena function, how this world grows together, where suffering comes from, and understanding our minds better. Once we have a realization of this, there will be a basic level of confidence which is also happiness is an umbrella term. Happiness doesn't always mean happy meal happy. Like, yay.

I'm always happy. Like, oh my god. There's this happy guy again. We become very annoying for others, you know? Oh, good morning.

You know? Oh, he's always happy. It's not that. It's a sense of inner confidence, being able to deal with whatever comes up with a sense of security and well-being that is always there. As once we have reached the click to have that within us, then we'll grow further and further and further.

And we can develop it up to a state which we call liberation from any form of emotional suffering and full enlightenment, which is what a Buddha has achieved, which is the ultimate form of perfect happiness. What that really means, we're also going to see. So, yes, a certain level remains. It's like a basic sense of confidence you're going to have. But it's not something static as such.

It is something that grows and develops further. And then allows you to actually bring your attention away from me and my happiness and turn your attention towards others. What about their happiness? Now, I'm okay, I'm fine. But others are suffering.

How can I use my own good situation that I've cultivated to also help others to be free from emotional suffering and achieve a more genuine sense of confidence and mental health that happens? Yeah? Okay. Yeah, one more here. Let me take a break.

So the question is, if I give other people happiness, will that also bring happiness to me? Or is it the opposite that first I have to make myself happy and then I can give others happiness? Well, there's two points here. When we I think as we all know, when you are contributing genuinely to another person's happiness, if you give a gift, if you do something that makes someone else happy, it also provides you with a sense of happiness, doesn't it? Often, it makes you more happy than getting something for yourself.

The beauty of causing happiness for more people or somebody else, a loved one, your child, your parent, your brother, your best friend or a stranger is a very genuine form of well-being, isn't it? But does that mean that we are now out to run around and try to help everybody without also looking at our own needs and our own situation first? No. It is also true that in order to be truly able to bring a sense of genuine happiness and well-being to others, somehow we also have to know what's happening in here and how can I, first of all, myself find a sense of stability to then, in a stable manner, share that with others? Which is to say, only looking at the moment right now to make other people happy and neglecting yourself and not knowing what's going on inside is not a final solution because it will lead us maybe to a point of burning out a bit because we are not stable in here, which we're also going to talk about on day 5 a lot, how to take care of that when we talk about compassion more.

So there needs to be a balance, a loving kindness and compassion for yourself as a human being, which then you can share with others on an even more stable level. So it's both. Yeah. Okay. I'm here.

So once you're aware about how a mind works, how do you find that balance, between, like so you said that if I'm working on myself and trying to cultivate your mind that actually Well, as you say, we have there is a great need to maintain a balance between I can cultivate a sense of inner happiness that is stable, that comes from working on my mind. But then you still have to live in the world and encounter material things and have a job and a family and you have to pay the school fee for your boy or whatever it is. Well, of course you can deal with them, you might enjoy them, you might have to take care of them, but then the balance that we have to have is that on a basic level, you don't put your whole trust on material things at all. There is a kind of a balance that is, yes, this is also needed in my life, but I know this is not the source of my well-being. This I don't identify with so much.

That actually comes from within, which means if things go wrong, if things go out of balance externally, which they do in normal life, although we try our best, we still take care of them, but on a fundamental level, we are not blown away, we are not thrown off the horse. We are stable in here and it doesn't cause us to fall into despair because we lost that thing which is my source of happiness. No. So you can begin that's actually the point is as soon as we start to look into the mind and develop things internally, that is the very beginning of striking a balance between the external, which is still important, but the internal becomes more important maybe. Like that.

At least same. Beginning at least same. Then maybe more closely. It's like watching a movie and like see it and not just It's a bit like that, right? You reestablish your relationship with what's happening in your life and what's going on in your mind.
