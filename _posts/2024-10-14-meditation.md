Meditation is an ancient technique practiced by many traditions worldwide, such as Hinduism, Yoga, Buddhism, Sikkhism, Sufism or Taoism. As we have seen in previous articles, meditation is key to understanding our [mind]({{ site.baseurl }}/the-mind) and to work towards the state of lasting [happiness]({{ site.baseurl }}/happiness). In this blog post, we’ll explore what meditation actually is, what are its goals and benefits, and what are the different forms of meditation.

# What Meditation Is – And What It Is Not

Meditation can sometimes be best understood by clarifying what it is not. Meditation is not (only):

- a relaxation technique
- a method for calming the mind
- a method for increasing concentration of the mind
- a way to bliss out in a trance-like state

While these elements may occur, they are not the main purpose of meditation. 

Meditation is also not about escaping from life’s problems or suppressing emotions. In fact, it’s quite the opposite—meditation allows us to face challenges more skillfully and with a fresh perspective.

Finally, it’s not simply about sitting still in a certain posture or controlling breathing.

# Definition and Goal

![simple_meditation]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/meditation/simple_meditation.webp)

The word "meditation" is derived from the Tibetan word *gom*, which means "to become familiar." Meditation helps us **familiarize with our own minds,** both its positive and negative aspects. Through meditation, we cultivate healthy states of mind such as kindness, compassion, joy, and patience, while also identifying and understanding harmful emotions like anger, jealousy, and fear. By doing so, we can gradually reduce negative emotions and increase positive qualities, ultimately transforming our mental patterns.

Meditation is a mental practice **aimed at transforming the mind** and **gaining a true understanding of reality**. It’s a set of practical psychological techniques designed to create long-term positive changes by cultivating a healthier, more constructive mind. In Buddhism, the ultimate goal of meditation is enlightenment.

# Stabilizing vs Analytical Meditation

There are two main types of meditation: stabilizing and analytical. 

**Stabilizing meditation** is focused on **developing concentration.** This practice allows one to concentrate on an object—whether it’s the breath, a mental image, or a concept—without interruption. The goal is to train the mind to remain stable, counteracting the typical restless "monkey mind." Over time, this leads to a peaceful, clear mind capable of single-pointed focus.

**Analytical meditation** aims to **develop insight and understanding of reality.** Through intellectual analysis. By reflecting on topics such as impermanence or compassion,, we identify misconceptions about ourselves and the world and replace them with more realistic views.

Stabilizing and analytical meditations complement each other and should be combined in one session. For example, when meditating on emptiness, we first analyze the concept based on knowledge, thoughts, and memories. When an intuitive understanding arises, we then focus single-pointedly on that experience, allowing the mind to fully absorb it. As concentration deepens, so does insight. This process should be repeated for lasting transformation.

Stabilizing meditations can also be more effective when paired with thoughtful analysis. Before starting meditation, it's helpful to examine our state of mind and clarify your purpose for practicing, which requires some analysis. If you find it hard to focus during the session, taking a moment to analyze what's causing the distraction can help refocus your attention on the breath. It's also beneficial to periodically check in on your mind to ensure it's staying on task and not wandering off into daydreams.

# Meditation Techniques

There are many meditation techniques out there. Here is a short overview of some of them.

## 1. Stabilizing Meditation

- **Shamatha meditation** (Skt. Calm Abiding) : To concentrate on a simple object (typically the breath) to stabilize the mind and develop single-pointed focus.
- **Anapana meditation** : Same as Shamatha
- **Mindfulness meditation** : To focus on breathing, sensations, or sounds, while observing thoughts and emotions without judgment.
- **Movement meditation** : To integrate mindfulness into physical movement of the body. This includes walking meditation, yoga asanas, Tai Chi.
- **Focused attention meditation** : To develop concentration on a single point or object. The object can be the breath, a candle flame (Tratak) or any specific object.
- **Mantra meditation :** To repeat sacred words (*mantra*) in order to calm the mind and promote focus.
- **Visualisation meditation** : To visualize images or objects in order to improve focus and manifest desired outcomes.

## 2. Analytical Meditation

- **Loving-Kindness meditation** (Skt. *Metta*) : To express love, compassion and kindness towards oneself and others.
- **Vipassana meditation** : To observe the physical sensations on different parts of the body without reacting, while understanding that these sensations are impermanent. The goal is to develop insight into the nature of reality.
- **Guided analytical meditation** : To follow a specific narrative about a particular concept (such as emptiness, impermanence, compassion) and use intellectual analysis in order to gain an intuitive understanding of the object.
- **Tonglen meditation** : To imagine breathing in the suffering of others and breathing out love and kindness to those in need. The goal is to practice compassion.

# 3. Tantric Meditation

These are esoteric practices from different traditions designed to help individuals reach an awakened state more swiftly. Initiation by an experienced teacher is often essential for undertaking these practices.

- **Dzogchen** (*The Great Perfection*) : Spritual practice of the Nyingma school aimed at realizing the inherent, natural state of mind.
- **Mahamudra** (*The Great Seal*) : Advanced method of the Kagyu school for realizing the true nature of the mind and the ultimate nature of reality.
- **Kalachakra** (*Wheel of Time*) : Practice of the Jonang school to transcend dualistic thinking and achieve enlightenment.
- **Kundalini** : To awaken and channel spiritual energy through the body through breathwork, chanting, and specific body movements (*kriyas*).

# Conclusion

Meditation is a practical tool for mental transformation that anyone can benefit from, regardless of background or experience. It offers both short-term and long-term benefits. While enlightenment may be the ultimate goal, even beginning meditators experience greater calm and a more balanced outlook on life. With consistent practice, meditation transforms not only our minds but also the way we engage with the world around us.
