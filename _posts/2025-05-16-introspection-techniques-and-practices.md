During my travels, I encountered remarkably diverse cultures. Yet one universal thread connects people across the world: spirituality—the search for the divine and the longing to understand oneself and one’s mind more deeply. 

Across time and place, cultures have attempted to describe the indescribable using human words and concepts, giving rise to a vast, eclectic collection of spiritual practices, introspective tools, philosophies, faiths, religions, ceremonies, therapies, healing techniques. For instance, some words for describing the divine include : God, Heaven, Allah, Yahweh, The Great Spirit, Pachamama, Brahman, Moksha, Nirvana, Enlightenment, Ultimate Truth or Tao.

This article lists and categorizes the spiritual and introspection practices I came across on my journeys. It is by no means exhaustive. As always, if you spot any inaccuracies, please kindly share them in the comments.

## 1. Substance-Based / Plant Medicine

- **Ayahuasca** (also known as **Yagé** in Colombia) : ****Psychedelic brew made from the Banisteriopsis caapi vine, ceremonial spiritual medicine used by shamans in the Amazon region.
- **Peyote** : Cactus found in Mexico which contains psychoactive mescaline, traditionally used for medical and religious purposes.

- **Kambô Cleansing** : Medicinal ritual that involves applying the poisonous secretions of a giant monkey frog from the Amazon region. During the ritual, a shaman burns several superficial holes onto people’s skin.
- **Yopo** : hallucinogenic snuff (bufotenin and DMT) used by Indigenous South American shamans to induce altered states of consciousness.
- **Bufo Alvarius** : Toad from northern Mexico whose skin produces a derivative of serotonine (5-HO-DMT), which is an hallucinogenic psychotropic. The substance is usually smoked.
- **Salvia Divinorum** : Psychoactive plant native to the cloud forests of Oaxaca, Mexico, traditionally used by Mazatec shamans for spiritual and healing purposes.

- **Mimosa Hostilis root bark** : Natural source of DMT, traditionally used in Jurema ceremonies (North East Brazil) for spiritual and healing purposes.
- **Acacia Confusa** : Tree native to Southeast Asia (Taiwan, Philippines, Hawaii) whose root bark contains DMT, used in traditional medicine and modern psychedelic preparations.

- **DMT (N,N-Dimethyltryptamine)** : Potent hallucinogen obtained through the extraction of various plants. It is rapidly broken down by the liver. For this reason, when ingested orally on its own, DMT is not active and is usually smoked instead. Certain substances (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors, MAOIs) "block" the liver's action and alter DMT's effects. This is the principle behind **ayahuasca**, a brew combining a DMT-containing plant with another plant containing MAOIs.
